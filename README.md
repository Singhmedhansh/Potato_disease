# Potato_disease: Intelligent Diagnostic & Risk Advisory System

An AI-powered precision agriculture platform built to help potato farmers in India detect foliar disease early, interpret model decisions, and act quickly with weather-aware risk advisory.

This project combines computer vision, explainable AI, and geospatial weather context to reduce crop-loss risk from **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**, while also identifying healthy plants.

## Academic Context

This work is developed as part of the **B.Tech AI/ML curriculum at RV College of Engineering (RVCE)** for EL (Experiential Learning), Semester 2.

## Why This Matters

Potato disease progression is strongly influenced by local weather conditions (humidity, temperature, airflow). A generic image classifier is often not enough for field decisions. This system extends disease classification into a practical advisory engine by coupling:

- Leaf-level disease detection
- Explainability via Grad-CAM
- Real-time weather context via geolocation + OpenWeather API
- Structured class-specific action plans for intervention

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Backend/API**: FastAPI + Uvicorn (`webapp/app.py`)
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **CNN Backbone**: EfficientNetB0 (`src/model.py`)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (HSV segmentation, image pre/post-processing)
- **Explainable AI**: Grad-CAM (`src/gradcam.py`)
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 template + Tailwind CSS dashboard (`webapp/templates/index.html`)
- **External Data**: OpenWeather API (weather-aware inference context)

## System Pipeline

The diagnosis flow is designed as a practical field pipeline:

1. **HSV-Based Leaf Segmentation** (`src/segmentation.py`)
2. **CNN Inference (EfficientNetB0-based model)** (`src/model.py` + loaded model in `webapp/app.py`)
3. **Grad-CAM Visualization for XAI** (`src/gradcam.py`)
4. **Risk and Advisory Enrichment** (weather + severity + treatment protocol logic in `webapp/app.py`)

### 1) HSV Leaf Segmentation

- Converts uploaded BGR image to HSV color space.
- Applies green-range thresholding (`lower_green` / `upper_green`) to isolate leaf tissue.
- Uses morphological open/close operations to denoise the mask.
- Extracts largest contour as leaf ROI.
- If segmentation fails (no contour), falls back to full image mask.

This gives robust preprocessing under non-lab image conditions and attempts to isolate the biologically relevant region.

### 2) CNN Inference

- Input resized to `224 x 224` and converted to RGB.
- Pixel scale intentionally kept in `[0, 255]` to match training preprocessing.
- Model outputs class probabilities for:
	- `Potato Early Blight`
	- `Potato Healthy`
	- `Potato Late Blight`

Architecture notes (`src/model.py`):

- EfficientNetB0 (`include_top=False`, ImageNet pretrained)
- Feature head: GAP -> BatchNorm -> Dense(256) -> Dropout(0.4) -> Dense(128) -> Dropout(0.3) -> Softmax
- Two-stage training pattern in `src/train.py`:
	- initial frozen-backbone training
	- controlled fine-tuning of final backbone layers

### 3) Grad-CAM Explainability

- Locates last convolution layer automatically (supports nested backbone structure).
- Computes class-specific gradients via `tf.GradientTape`.
- Produces normalized heatmap and resizes to input resolution.
- Overlays heatmap on original image for interpretability.

The output is returned in API response as `heatmap_url` and rendered in dashboard for trust-building and clinical-style diagnosis review.

## `/predict` Endpoint Deep-Dive

Primary API: `POST /predict`

### Request Inputs

- `file`: leaf image (`multipart/form-data`)
- `lat`: user latitude (from browser geolocation)
- `lon`: user longitude (from browser geolocation)

### Internal Decision Flow

1. Reads uploaded image to temporary path.
2. Runs segmentation and computes leaf-pixel quality gates.
3. Falls back to original image if segmentation confidence is low.
4. Runs model prediction and selects top class + confidence.
5. Generates Grad-CAM heatmap and computes severity percentage.
6. Fetches weather using OpenWeather (`temperature`, `humidity`, `wind_speed`, `sunlight_hours`).
7. Computes risk analytics (if non-healthy class):
	 - `risk_score` (0-10)
	 - `risk_level` (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
	 - `spread_probability`
	 - `yield_impact`
	 - `treatment_urgency`
8. Maps predicted class to pathogen metadata and class-specific treatment protocols.
9. Returns structured diagnosis payload for dashboard rendering.

### Weather-Aware Risk Metrics

Risk is not based on class label alone. The service combines:

- Visual severity from Grad-CAM-activated regions
- Real-time humidity and temperature
- Derived spread probability and expected yield impact

This enables field-relevant advisories instead of static classification.

### Class-Specific Action Plans

The API returns `treatment_plan` with sections:

- `immediate`: immediate containment actions
- `chemical`: fungicide table with rate / interval / PHI
- `prevention`: long-term agronomic prevention strategy

For `Potato Healthy`, severity/risk outputs are neutralized and treatment sections adapt accordingly.

## UI/UX Highlights

Frontend: `webapp/templates/index.html`

- Tailwind CSS powered diagnostics dashboard with responsive layout.
- Real-time pipeline status steps (segmentation -> classifier -> Grad-CAM -> risk -> report).
- Dynamic rendering of treatment protocols from API payload:
	- immediate action checklist
	- chemical treatment table
	- prevention cards
- Class-aware and severity-aware badges (diagnosis severity, urgency, risk visibility).
- Grad-CAM panel with side-by-side original specimen and heatmap.
- Weather context panel (temperature, humidity, wind, sunlight) tied to user geolocation.
